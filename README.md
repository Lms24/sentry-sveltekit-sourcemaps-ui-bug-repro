# Reproduction

This reproduction attempted to reproduce a UI bug in Sentry where a source-mapped error would still cause the source maps wizard dialog/box (previously the "Sentry not part if CI" box) to appear above the stacktrace.

However, it seems like we fixed this since I last saw this in an issue. Keeping this repro around for further investigation if necessary.
